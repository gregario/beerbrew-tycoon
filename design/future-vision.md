# Future Vision Notes

Captured from design brainstorming sessions. NOT in scope for current stage — reference when designing later stages.

## Core Philosophy

The game IS the learning journey. You're learning to brew, not being taught brewing science. Equipment and experience gate what information the player sees, not UI toggles.

Differs from Game Dev Tycoon: GDT rewards always-higher scores. BeerBrew splits — artisan rewards variety/experimentation, commercial rewards consistency/volume.

## Taste Skill System (Future: post-1B)

- **General + style-specific**: general taste improves with every brew, style expertise tracks per-style
- **Growth vectors**: brewing (passive), training courses (costs money + turns), meta-progression
- **Discovery mechanic**: chance-based — chance to discover a flavor attribute of a beer, then chance to link that attribute to a specific process step
- **Not capped per tier** but gear/courses improve discovery chance rates
- **Feedback depth scales with taste level**: friends shrug → vague impressions → specific tasting notes → full breakdown with process attribution

## Quality Scoring Animation (Future: post-1B)

- Game Dev Tycoon-style bubble animation after each brewing phase
- Bubbles float up representing quality points and off-flavors
- Total score starts small for home brewing, grows with equipment + experience
- Cost AND time factor into the phase (not just slider position)

## Equipment-Driven UI Progression

- **Garage**: eyeballing it — sliders show physical actions (time, heat, location), no numbers
- **Thermometer upgrade**: reveals temperature on mashing slider
- **Digital controller**: shows fermentation temp + yeast ideal range
- **All-in-one system**: full dashboard — all numbers, fermentability %, alpha acid utilization
- **Water chemistry kit**: unlocks water profile adjustments (late game)

## Brewing Journal / Book

- Physical notebook aesthetic early game → software app late game
- Populated as you brew — each brew adds an entry
- Animation: pages filling in during brew stages
- End-of-brew: friends drinking animation (early) → magazine reviews / beer app ratings (late)
- Could be the history page, evolving through stages

## "Good Combo" Discovery System

- Like Game Dev Tycoon's "good combo" markers
- Unlocked via in-game taste skill AND meta-progression
- Style-specific: brewing lots of IPAs teaches you IPA combos
- Markers appear on sliders/recipe UI once discovered

## Endgame Divergence

### Artisan Path
- Success through variety, experimentation, always improving
- Grow ingredients on-site for authenticity kudos
- Open an on-site pub with its own staff
- Like Wicklow Wolf — craft identity, limited runs

### Commercial Path
- Spin popular beers into solo production lines
- Consistent output at volume
- Marketing campaigns, events, merchandise (t-shirts etc.)
- Like Guinness (iconic single product) or BrewDog (punk brand + scale)

### Shared Late Game
- Hire famous brewers via recruitment system
- Unlock special ingredient/process combos
- Achievements tied to endgame path milestones
- Starting decade selection (unlocked via milestones) — 80s, 90s, 2000s etc.

## Historical Progression Theme

- Start as 18/21-year-old learning to brew in the 80s
- Equipment releases historically over time (like GDT's game industry timeline)
- Seasoned brewer in present day has access to modern equipment
- Pick starting decade on repeat playthroughs (unlockable)
- Decade affects available equipment, styles trending, market conditions
